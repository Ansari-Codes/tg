### Workspace Layout

The editor page is divided into three main sections for an efficient workflow:

1. **Code Editor**: The central area where you write your Python scripts
2. **Log Area**: Positioned below the editor, this shows output messages, errors, and logs
3. **Canvas**: Located on the right side, this is where your turtle drawings appear in real-time

This layout allows you to **code, debug, and visualize** your projects seamlessly. Whether you are experimenting with shapes, patterns, or complete projects, everything is available in one interactive workspace.
